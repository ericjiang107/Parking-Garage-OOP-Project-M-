# Parking-Garage-OOP-Project-M-

I was responsible for creating the function side of the code. Because Ala and I think differently we decided to perform from each other's strengths. 
So I started working on the call function so that we would have something easier to look at and understand which direction we wanted to head into. From
this project, I learned a lot and even more on how classes worked. At first, it was a bit difficult to grasp the understanding but after being shown how
it works, it was a lot easier to work with especially after having a few days to play around with the code.
